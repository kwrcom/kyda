# Reason: Python dependencies for Spark Streaming application
# PySpark is included in the bitnami/spark image, but we need additional packages

# No additional Python packages needed for basic Spark Streaming
# The Spark image includes all necessary dependencies

# If you need additional packages in the future, add them here
# For example:
# kafka-python==2.0.2
# pandas==2.0.0

# For local development / unit testing you can install pyspark
# Note: the containerized Spark image already includes the runtime.
pyspark==3.5.0
# Kafka and Redis clients are used by the streaming job for side-effects (writing hot features / producing to extra topics)
kafka-python==2.0.2
redis==4.6.0
